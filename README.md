# Aim: To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Algorithm: To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

# Objective

To demonstrate how different prompting techniques—such as query decomposition, decision-making, and semantic filtering—influence the quality, coherence, and structure of AI-generated content like reports, articles, case studies, and creative works.

# Prompting Techniques Overview
| Technique                      | Description                                                                          | Example Use                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Decomposition**        | Breaking a complex query into smaller, simpler sub-queries for clarity and accuracy. | Instead of “Write a detailed report on AI ethics,” ask: “1. List ethical issues in AI. 2. Explain one issue in detail. 3. Suggest solutions.” |
| **Decision-Making Prompts**    | Asking the model to choose among alternatives or justify choices.                    | “Compare CNN and RNN for text classification and recommend the best one with reasons.”                                                        |
| **Semantic Filtering**         | Guiding the model to focus on certain meanings, tones, or content scopes.            | “Write a news article about renewable energy using a neutral and factual tone.”                                                               |
| **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** | Asking the model to reason step-by-step before answering.                            | “Think step by step: How does reinforcement learning differ from supervised learning?”                                                        |
| **Role Prompting**             | Assigning a specific persona or role to improve style/accuracy.                      | “Act as a data scientist writing a project summary for non-technical stakeholders.”                                                           |
| **Few-shot Prompting**         | Providing examples to guide the model’s output style or logic.                       | “Example 1: … Example 2: … Now write a similar paragraph on robotics.”                                                                        |


# Result :  The corresponding prompt executed successfully.
